# Stuff

## Notes

These tools have worked well together:

- [scapr](https://github.com/wmelvin/scapr) - Capture screenshots.
- [ImagePicker](https://github.com/wmelvin/ImagePicker) - Pick from captured screenshots.
- [image-snip](https://github.com/wmelvin/image-snip) - Do things with the selected images such as crop, add text footers, or make an animated GIF.

<sub>Perhaps *"miscellany"* would be a better title, but *"stuff"* is shorter (and it's nicer than *"crap"*).</sub>
